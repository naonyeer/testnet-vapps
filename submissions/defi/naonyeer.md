## Project

### Name & Category

* **Project:** LP Streak Attest
* **Category:** DeFi

### Description

**Problem:** Many DeFi programs want to incentivize liquidity providers who contribute consistently (not just “hit-and-run”), but proving consistency across protocols and chains without exposing sensitive data is difficult.

**Solution:** LP Streak Attest issues verifiable attestations proving that a wallet has maintained an LP position for ≥ N consecutive days or above a certain threshold. These attestations are portable and can be used by other protocols for fee rebates, allowlists, or bonus rewards—without revealing the exact LP amount.

---

## SL Integration

* **Attestations:** Issue verifiable attestations containing “LP ≥ threshold” + “streak duration (days/weeks)”.
* **Proofs:** Start with deterministic snapshot proofs; plan to upgrade to threshold/range proofs (proving ≥ X without revealing the exact value) once ZK/SL primitives are available.
* **Verification:** Third-party dApps call the verifier (via SDK/CLI) to validate attestations before granting incentives.

---

## Technical

### Architecture (high level)

1. **Indexer Worker**: Reads LP positions from subgraphs/RPCs (e.g., Uniswap v2/v3) on a scheduled interval → calculates streaks & thresholds.
2. **Attestation Service**: Generates and signs SL attestations when conditions are met.
3. **Verifier API / SDK**: Lightweight endpoint for dApps to verify attestations through the Soundness Layer.
4. **Web Dashboard**: Wallet connection to track streak progress, request attestations, and export/claim at partner protocols.

### Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Wagmi/Viem
* **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript)
* **Blockchain:** EVM testnets (Sepolia / OP-Sepolia) + Soundness Layer
* **Storage:** Postgres (for caching); metadata optionally stored on IPFS/WALRUS

### Features

* **F1. Streak Tracker:** Tracks daily/weekly LP streaks per pool.
* **F2. Threshold Attestation:** Issues attestations like “LP ≥ X for Y days.”
* **F3. Partner Verifier:** Lightweight library for protocols to verify attestations and grant incentives (rebates, allowlists, bonuses).

---

## Timeline

### PoC (2–4 weeks)

* Integrate LP position tracking for 1–2 DEX testnets
* Generate and verify basic SL attestations
* Minimal UI for wallet connection & attestation requests

### MVP (4–8 weeks)

* Multi-pool & multi-chain support
* Verifier SDK + demo rewards claim page
* Automated snapshots & monitoring, stress-tested at scale

---

## Innovation

* **Portable LP Reputation:** Brings “consistent LP” reputation across protocols without requiring KYC.
* **Privacy-Aware:** Uses attestations/thresholds without revealing the exact LP values.
* **Sybil-Resistant Incentives:** Rewards are tied to sustained liquidity, not short-term farming.
